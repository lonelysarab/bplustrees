  <H1>Welcome to JHAV&Eacute; Client 2.0</H1>
With this software still in beta testing please feel free to e-mail us with any
problems you run into.<br>
Keep checking <a href="http://jhave.org">http://jhave.org</a>
for updates. If you are using Webstart to launch your client, these
updates will be deployed "automagically" each time you start your
client.
  <H2>How do I use JHAV&Eacute;?</H2>
Using JHAV&Eacute; is as simple as following the directions in the
panel below! Make sure the
server and category are correct for your class and connect to the server. Once connected
select an algorithm, click visualize, and, if needed, select or
create the dataset that will provide input to the algorithm.
It's that easy!
