<H1>How do I use A<SMALL>NIMAL</SMALL>?</H1>

A<SMALL>NIMAL</SMALL>'s display is divided in three sections: the
<EM>display speed and magnification</EM> at the top, the actual
<EM>animation content</EM> in the middle, and the <EM>animation
control</EM> at the bottom.

<H2>Animation Speed Control</H2>

Use the slider in the top left region of the window to control the
animation speed. The speed is given as a percentage between 10% (0.1x)
and 1000% (10x) of the original speed. The button next to the slider
can be used to reset the speed to 100% (1x).

<H2>Animation Magnification Control</H2>

Use the slider in the top right region of the window to control the
magnification of the animation. The magnification is given as a
percentage between 0% (single pixel) and 500% (5x). The button next to
the slider can be used to reset the magnification to 100% (1x).


<H2>Running the Animation</H2>

A<SMALL>NIMAL</SMALL> animations can be displayed in both forwards and
backwards. There are three different animation display modes: static
single step, single step with smooth motions, and slide show.
The animation proceeds to the next animation step after an appropriate
button is pressed, or automatically after a defined delay. The
control panel at the bottom contains the following buttons, from left
to right:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>start of animation</EM> (|&lt;&lt;) - jump to the start of the
animation. Turned off when already at the animation start.

<LI><EM>jump to previous step</EM> (|&lt;) - jump to the start of the
previous step, without showing a smooth animation of the animation
effects.

<LI><EM>reverse slide-show</EM> (<U>&lt;&lt;</U>) - display the
animation backwards by linking all steps. Can be stopped by the pause
button. 

<LI><EM>reverse play</EM> (&lt;) - display the previous animation step
in reverse order with smooth effects.

<LI><EM>pause</EM> (||) - pause the display between the next steps.

<LI><EM>play</EM> (&lt;) - display the current animation step with
smooth effects. 

<LI><EM>forward slide-show</EM> (<U>&gt;&gt;</U>) - display the
animation by linking all steps. Can be stopped by the pause
button. 

<LI><EM>jump to next step</EM> (|&gt;) - jump to the start of the
next step, without showing a smooth animation of the animation
effects. 

<LI><EM>end of animation</EM> (|&gt;&gt;) - jump to the end of the
animation. Turned off when already at the animation end.
</UL>

<H2>Animation Step Control</H2>

You can enter the number of the step you want to jump to in the
text field at the bottom of the display. Note: as the numbering
reflects the animation generation process, the animation may skip
some steps, and the numbering may not be in order! Instead, you can
use the slider at the bottom right to adjust the percentage of the
animation shown, between 0% (start) and 100% (end) of the animation.


<H2>Quiz Mode</H2>

Some algorithm animations have accompanying questions. These are shown
in the info frame also containing this documentation.
