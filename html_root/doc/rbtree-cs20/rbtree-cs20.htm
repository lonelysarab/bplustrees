<P>Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a red-black search tree. The order of arrival of data
for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot, with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
A red circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a red pointer, and a black circular node indicates
that the node is pointed to by a black pointer. Remember that the rules for adding new values to a red-black tree
are as follows:

<OL>
<LH>
</LH>
	<LI>Create a new node n to hold the value,
	<LI>If the tree is empty, make n the root,
	<LI>Otherwise, go left or right, as with normal insertion in a binary search tree, except that if you pass through
	a node m with red links to both of its children -- color those links black and,if m is not the root, color m's
	parent link red.
	<LI>Finally, at the appropriate leaf, add n as a child with a red link to its parent.
</OL>

<P>If either step that adds red links (3 or 4) causes there to be 2 red links in a row, rotate the associated nodes
to create a node with 2 red links to its children.
