<font size=+2>Extensible Hashing</font><font size=+1></font>
<p>Extensible hashing is a form of dynamic hashing.&nbsp; It allows data
of any size to be stored and accessed in constant time.&nbsp; Unlike with
conventional hashing techniques, extensible hashing solves the problem
of collisions by allowing the allocated size of the directory&nbsp; to
grow and shrink as new elements are added or removed.
