<h1>Heap Sort</h1>
<p>Heap sort is the least efficient 


 of the O(n log(n)) complexity sorts. However, it becomes very useful when sorting extremely large sets of data items because it can be done utilizing one array of items as opposed to multiple arrays used by other O(n log(n)) sorts. </p>
<p>Heap sort accomplishes the goal of sorting by creating a heap of the data items in the array. This heap will be in the form of a binary tree with all items below a node smaller than that node. Thus, the largest item in the heap is the top node. Heap sort takes this heap, removes the top item from the tree and places it at the last location in the tree, thus making the largest item be the last in the array. This item is then removed from consideration within the heap. Then it moves a node from the bottom of the tree (leaf at maximum depth) to the top and rebuilds the tree to be in the appropriate order. Heap sort then repeats this cycle. </p>
