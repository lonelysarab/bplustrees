<P>Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a 2-3-4 search tree. The order of arrival of data for
the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot, with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.  If
the datum set off by asterisks is already in the tree, the excursion down a path in the tree should be viewed as
a &quot;find&quot; operation instead of an &quot;insert&quot;.</P>

<P>All nodes in a 2-3-4 tree are one of three types:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>2-nodes containing two pointers and one data item
	<LI>3-nodes containing three pointers and two data items
	<LI>4-nodes containing four pointers and three data items
</UL>

<P>In this implemetation of the 2-3-4 tree structure, a 4-node is split whenever it is encountered on a trip down
a path in the tree. Each time a node is added (by entering through the root), try to predict what nodes will be
split and the final location of the new value in the tree.  If you turn on quiz mode, you will asked about the
splitting of nodes as you travel down the insertion path.
