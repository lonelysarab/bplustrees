<P>Once we start the right-to-left pass through the pattern, we continue until a mismatch occurs between a character
in the master string and a character in the pattern. When that occurs, the rightmost character of the pattern is
realigned to a position that is obtained by adding the index (in the master string) at which the mismatch occurred
to the maximum of the entry in the two realignment arrays.</P>

<P><B>Note:  If your master string is relatively long, it will not fit conveniently into the graphic window.  Shrinking
it will make the font too small to read, so you'll have to &quot;pan&quot; the data structure instead.  Merely
hold the mouse down in the graphic window, drag it, and the data structure will move along with it -- allowing
you to see portions that were originally outside the window.</B>
