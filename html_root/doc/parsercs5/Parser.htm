As the infix expression is parsed into RPN form, operands will move directly to the postfix string.
Operators are pushed onto the stack, and "escape" when the priority of an operator on top of the stack
is greater than or equal to the priority of an operator from the infix expression.  If a left parenthesis
is encountered in the infix expression, it's immediately pushed onto the stack, 
and a new subexpression is parsed until
the matching right parenthesis is encountered.
