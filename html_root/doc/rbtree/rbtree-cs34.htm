Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a red-black search tree.
The order of arrival of data for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot,
with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
A red circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a red pointer, and a
black circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a black pointer.
Remember that groups of reb-black nodes can always be mapped to nodes in a 2-3-4 tree.
In the 2-3-4 tree underlying this implementation of red-black trees, a 4-node 
(that is, one with
3 data items and four pointers) is split whenever it is encountered on a trip
down a path in the tree.
Each time a node is added (by entering through the root), try to predict its
final location in the tree before proceeding to the next snapshot.
