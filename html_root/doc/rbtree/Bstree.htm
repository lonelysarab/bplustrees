Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a binary search tree.
The order of arrival of data for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot,
with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
Each time a node is added (by entering through the root), try to predict its
final location in the tree before proceeding to the next snapshot.
