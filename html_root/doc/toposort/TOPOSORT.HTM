In the topological ordering algorithm depicted here, green nodes have been added
to the topological order and yellow nodes are in the queue, waiting to be added
because their predecessors have all been added to the topological order.  Red
arrows are used to highlight edges leading from nodes already in the topological
order.  As 
you step through the algorithm, always try to predict the next node 
that will be added to the topological order and the queue.
