<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
<p> Given a list of ints stored in an array, a bubble sort causes a pass through the array to compare adjacent pairs of keys. Whenever two keys are out of order with respect to each other, the associated objects are interchanged.  


Notice that after such a pass, we are assured that the list will have the integer that comes last in order in the final array position. That is, the largest integer will &quot;sink&quot; to the bottom of the array, and smaller values will gradually &quot;percolate&quot; to the top. </p>
<p> If one pass through an array of <em>n </em> keys guarantees that the key last in order is in the appropriate position, then completing the second pass using the same logic will guarantee that the second largest value is in the appropriate position. Repeating the process for a total of <em>n </em> - 1 passes eventually ensures that all objects are in their appropriate positions. In general, on the <em>k </em>th pass through the array, <em>n </em> - <em>k </em> comparisons of pairs must be made. </p>
<p>However, if the algorithm ever passes through the sequence without causing an interchange the list is in order and the algorithm no longer needs to continue. Straight bubble sort does not evaluate for this situation, though. </p>
