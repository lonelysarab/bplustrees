<P>In the version of the Gale-Shipley stable marriage algorithm being visualized here, men are the proposers. Men
who are not yet matched with a woman are processed in highest number to lowest number fashion. A snapshot is presented
each time a proposal made by a man breaks up a previous engagement and then results in a new engagement. In the
preference grid, yellow is used to highlight the proposal currently causing activity, and blue is used to highlight
past proposals.
