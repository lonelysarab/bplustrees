<BODY BGCOLOR="#99CCFF">

<P>In the visualization of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm you are watching here</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Red is used to highlight the edges that have been included in the MST.
	<LI>Blue highlights those edges that are in the priority queue ordered by edgeweight.
	<LI>Edges that are black have been removed from the priority queue but have not been added to the MST because they
	join vertices that are already in a connected component.
</UL>

<P>As you step through the algorithm, always try to predict the next edge that will be included. Remember the selection
criterion employed at each stage of the Kruskal algorithm -- select the first edge from the priority queue that
joins two vertices between which a path does not already exist.
