In the heap sort algorithm being visualized here, you see the array
represented as a binary tree.  That is, you are viewing the binary tree that 
is implicitly embedded in the array.  There are two numbers in each tree
node. The top number is the array index (based on array indices starting
at 1) and the bottom number is the datum in that array index.
