Reattore HTTP Server

Online documentation (much better than this):

Reattore is a simple single threaded HTTP server written in Java.
Unlike most Java server applications, Reattore uses the socket channel
features added in Java 1.4 to serve all requests from one thread,
instead of spawning each request off to a new thread.  In theory this
provides better performance and allows the system to degrade well
under high load.

To run
------
You *must* have Java 1.4.1 installed

To run, type:
  java -jar lib/reattore.jar

This will start up the server using the default
etc/default-config.xml, which serves the files below the test-site
directory.

See etc/default-config.xml and etc/max-config.xml for examples of how
to configure the server.  The default config is very simple but
contains little extra that could influence the benchmarks.

To run using a different config file, type:
  java -jar lib/reattore.jar <config-file-name.xml>

Unfortunately the Apache digester module used for the configuration
doesn't report any errors in the config file.  If the system doesn't
work as expected check your spelling and order.

To test
-------
I recommend the ApacheBench (ab) program that is included with all
recent versions of Apache.  To test, try:

  ab -k -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/index.html

or for bandwidth testing:

  ab -k -n 10000 -c 10 http://localhost:8080/medium.bin

Note that as the tests are on static files the system can saturate
most network connections.  Using ab Version 2.0.40-dev on my
iBook/800MHz using a pre-release of the jdk (build 1.4.1-beta-20) the
basic results are:

Time per request: 1.102 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:    29127.05 [Kbytes/sec] received
