<p align="left"><big><big>The topological order algorithm provides a linear
ordering in which vertices could be visited such that, at the time a vertex is
visited, all vertices preceding it have already been visited.&nbsp; If vertices
represent courses in your computer science curriculum and edges represent a
prerequisite structure among those courses, then one can think of a topological
order as providing a linear sequence in which these courses could be
taken.&nbsp; </big></big></p>
<p align="left"><big><big>In the algorithm visualized here, vertices move from
the queue to the topological order.&nbsp; Once a vertex is in the topological
order, edges leading from it switch color from black to red.&nbsp; A vertex
enters the queue only after all vertices immediately preceding it are have been
included in the topological order.&nbsp; (In the course-and-prerequisite
analogy, this means that a course enters the queue only after all of its
prerequisites have been completed.)&nbsp; Hence, as one vertex moves from the
queue to the topological order, zero or more additional vertices may become
eligible to enter the queue.&nbsp; In any given step of the algorithm pictured
here, if one vertex being added to the topological order triggers more than one
vertex entering the queue, these new vertices are enqueued in ascending
numerical order.</big></big></p>
