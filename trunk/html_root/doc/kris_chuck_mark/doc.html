<h1>Infix-to-postfix</h1>

<p>Converting an infix expression to postfix is an application using
queues and stacks. Students should already understand the details of
the queue and stack ADTs. Queue operations used are enqueue(),
dequeue(), and isEmpty(). Stack operations used are pop(), push(),
peek(), and is Empty().  </p>
 

<p>Order of precedence must be preserved during the conversion. Each
token of the infix expression will be dequeued; its token type will be
determined; and the token, along with other relevant tokens, will be
handled properly depending on the token type.  </p>

<p>The token type will be denoted by colors:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>operand Green</li?

  <li>operations Blue
  </li>

  <li><strong>(</strong> Yellow
  </li>
  <li><strong>)</strong> Red
  </li>

</ul>
 

Also, the empty infix queue will be denoted by purple. Each snapshot will illustrate the handling of one token.
