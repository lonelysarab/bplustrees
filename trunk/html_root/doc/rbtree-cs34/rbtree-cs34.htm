<P>Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a red-black search tree. The order of arrival of data
for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot, with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
If the datum set off by asterisks is already in the tree, the excursion down a path in the tree should be viewed
as a &quot;find&quot; operation instead of an &quot;insert&quot;.  A red circular node indicates that the node
is pointed to by a red pointer, and a black circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a black pointer.
Remember that groups of red-black nodes can always be mapped to nodes in a 2-3-4 tree. In the 2-3-4 tree implicitly
underlying this red-black tree, a 4-node (that is, one with 3 data items and four pointers) is split whenever it
is encountered on a trip down a path in the tree. </P>

<P>When a new node is inserted, you will occasionally see a node's color change to yellow.  This is to indicate
that the yellow node is currently being visited on the insertion path for the new node.  If &quot;quiz mode&quot;
is on, you will be asked a question about whether the highlighted node will change.  &quot;Change&quot; here refers
to the relative positioning of the highlighted node in the 2-3-4 tree underlying the red-black tree.  If you answer
that the highlighted node will change, try to predict the exact nature of  that change will be before clicking
the &quot;next snapshot&quot; button.</P>
