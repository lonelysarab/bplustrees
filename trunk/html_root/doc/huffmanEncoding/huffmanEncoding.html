<h2>Huffman Encoding</h2>
<p>The construction of a Huffman tree requires two passes through the
  character string that we are trying to encode.  The first pass
  merely builds a table of frequency counts of each character in the
  string.  It is convenient to think of each character and its
  corresponding frequency count stored in a one-node tree when this first pass is completed.  
</p>
<div class="p">
  <!---->
</div>
After building up these frequency counts in the first pass through the
character string, the one-node trees containing the characters and
their counts are inserted into a priority queue.  The priority
underlying this queue is based on a comparison in which a lower
frequency count corresponds to a higher priority (and hence earlier
removal from the queue).  Once this
priority queue is established, the Huffman tree construction algorithm
proceeds as follows:

<ol type="1">
  <li> Remove from the priority queue the two trees with the smallest frequencies.
    <div class="p">
      <!---->
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Form a new tree having the two trees from previous step as its
    children, and having a root node whose frequencies are the sum of the
    frequencies in its two subtrees.
    <div class="p">
      <!---->
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> Insert this new tree into the priority queue.
    <div class="p">
      <!---->
    </div>
  </li>
  <li> Repeat the preceding three steps until
    the priority queue has only one tree in it. That tree is the final Huffman tree.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Once the tree is constructed, we can determine the bit sequence encoding for each character in the original string. The characters are in the leaf nodes of the Huffman tree. As you walk down a path in the tree leading to such a leaf node, each left branch followed in that path adds a 0 to the encoding for the string, and each right branch adds a 1.</p>
