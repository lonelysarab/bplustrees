<P>In the bitonic merge sort algorithm, parallel 'binary split' processes are used to refine an array into successively
larger bitonic lists, that is, lists that have at most one local max or min. In the final stage of the algorithm,
the entire array is just one big bitonic list. When that occurs, the binary split partner processes are applied
to sort the array using the bitonic sort.  Remember the distinction between the <I>bitonic sort</I> and the <I>bitonic
merge sort</I>.  The former only sorts a bitonic list while the latter sorts an arbitrary list by successively
refining it until it becomes a bitonic list and then applying the bitonic sort.</P>

<P>The array is refined into successively larger bitonic lists by sorting segments into alternate ascending/descending
order. In the visualization the color red is used to highlight segments that are being sorted into ascending order,
and blue is used to highlight segments that are being sorted into descending order. When two items in the array
are being compared by a pair of partner binary split processes, they are momentarily highlighted yellow.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Note:</FONT>  </B>Remember that the bitonic merge sort algorithm is a parallel algorithm.
This visualization is best viewed with &quot;quiz mode&quot; turned on, especially when you are first practicing
with the algorithm.  When quiz mode is on, all the swaps that occur between questions of the form <I>&quot;the
distance between 'binary split' partner processes will be ?????&quot; </I> would actually occur in parallel. However,
to allow you to better understand the individual swaps that are made, the visualization slows them down so that
they appear to occur in sequence.
