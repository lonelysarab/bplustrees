<BODY>
In the heap insertion algorithm being visualized here, you see the binary
tree embedded in an array.  There are two numbers in each tree
node. The top number is the array index (based on array indices starting
at 1) and the bottom number is the datum in that array index.  As a datum arrives
for insertion in the heap, it is initially placed in the last array location.
That datum must them be walked a path in the tree by (repeatedly) comparing it to its
parent.  The visualization show the state of the tree before and after this
"walk-up" algorithm.
