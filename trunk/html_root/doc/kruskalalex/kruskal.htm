	<LI><P>Edges that are black have been removed from the priority

<P>As you step through the algorithm, always try to predict the next
edge that will be included. Remember the selection criterion employed
at each stage of the Kruskal algorithm -- select the first edge from
the priority queue that joins two vertices between which a path does
not already exist.   In the visualization you are watching here,
should two edges in the priority queue have the same edge weight, the
one with a smaller vertex number  will always come first.  For
example, if edges connecting vertices 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 both have
edgeweight 12, the edge connecting 2 to 4 will come first in the
queue.</P>
