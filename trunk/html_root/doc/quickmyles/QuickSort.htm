<h1>Quick Sort</h1>
<p>Quick Sort is a divide and conquer technique which locates a pivot item within the data set and uses it to seperate the items in the list according to whether they are larger or smaller than the pivot. Items smaller than the pivot are placed in before the pivot and items larger than the pivot are placed after the pivot. Thus the pivot is now in its correct location according to all other items in the set. Then the subsets on each side of the pivot are sorted recursively in the same fashion. </p>
<p>Variations: There are two basic variations on this technique. The basic implementation of this algorithm(used here) utilizes the first item in the data set as its pivot point where the alternative implementation utilizes a random pivot item in each pass. </p>
