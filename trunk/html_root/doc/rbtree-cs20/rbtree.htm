Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a red-black search tree.
The order of arrival of data for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot,
with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
A red circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a red pointer, and a
black circular node indicates that the node is pointed to by a black pointer.
Remember that the rules for adding new values to a red-black tree are as follows:
<OL>
<LH></LH>
<LI> Create a new node n to hold the value, 
<LI> If the tree is empty, make n the root, 
<LI> Otherwise, go left or right, as with normal insertion in a binary search tree, except that if you pass 
through a node m with red links to both of its children -- color those links black and,if m is not the 
root, color m's parent link red.  
<LI> Finally, at the appropriate leaf, add n as a child with a red link to its parent.

</OL>
If either step that adds red links (3 or 4) causes there to be 2 red links in a row, rotate the 
associated nodes to create a node with 2 red links to its children.
