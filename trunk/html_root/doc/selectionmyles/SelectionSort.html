<h1>Selection Sort </h1>
<p> The selection sort algorithm has a similar structure to bubble sort, but it attempts to avoid the multitude of interchanges of adjacent entries. To do this, on the <em>k </em>th pass through the array, it determines the position of the smallest entry within the list. 


Then this smallest entry is swapped with the <em>k </em>th entry, k is incremented by 1, and the process is repeated. </p>
<p>While selection sort also consists of an inner and outer loop, however, selection sort only interchanges items once the inner loop is exited. This apparently reduces the number of data interchanges and makes the selection sort more efficient that the bubble sort. </p>
