<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFF66">

<P>In Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm visualized here, red is used to highlight the start node and the edges
that have been included in the MST. Green highlights the nodes that have been closed and therefore included in
the developing tree up to the current point of execution. Yellow highlights those nodes that have opened by the
underlying priority first search but not yet been included in the MST. As you step through the algorithm, always
try to predict the next node (and corresponding edge) that will be included. Remember the selection criterion employed
at each stage of the Prim algorithm -- include the node connected by an edge of minimal weight to a node that has
already been included.
