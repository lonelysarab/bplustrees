<P>After a summer off-line due to installation of a campus firewall and a complete rewrite of our algorithm visualization
software, the Lawrence Algorithm Visualization Web Server is back on-line. If you're not in a Lawrence computer
science course and just want to get a glimpse of what the new environment looks like follow the link below. Right
now you'll only find two algorithms to play with here -- the 0/1 Knapsack problem and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string
search algorithm. This is because we're still in the process of beta testing the system. However, once we confirm
that everything is working correctly both inside and outside the firewall, we anticipate that more algorithms will
appear in the very near future. In the meantime, we'd appreciate your feedback on the algortihms we do have. Send
e-mail to thomas.naps@lawrence.edu.</P>

If you're enrolled in CMSC34 (Algorithms &amp; Data Structures) you'll want to follow the link below. In addition
to helping you learn some of the algorithms we're studying, it should also help you maximize your quiz grade. Why?
If you can answer correctly the questions asked while you're watching, the visualization of an algorithm, they
will prepare you for the kinds of questions you'll be asked in quizzes!</P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">For students in CMSC34, you can play with the compression algorithms that we have been
studying in class using the &quot;LZ&quot; Java application developed by Prof. Sami Khuri of San Jose State. To
run this application on the Briggs 419 workstations, merely manuever to the LZ directory and run the program LZ.exe.
If you want to use this application on your personal computer, copy the contents of the LZ directory to a similar
directory on your machine and then start the java application via &quot;java LZ&quot;.</FONT></I></P>
