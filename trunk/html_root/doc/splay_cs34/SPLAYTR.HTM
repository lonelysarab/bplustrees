<P>Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a splay search tree. The order of arrival of data for
the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot, with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks. If
the datum set off by asterisks is already in the tree, the excursion down a path in the tree should be viewed as
a &quot;find&quot; operation instead of an &quot;insert&quot;.  Remember that, in a play tree, after an item is
inserted or found, it goes through a sequence of rotations to bring it up to the root of the tree.  </P>

<P>In the visualization, when an insert or find occurs, you will see a node highlighted in yellow.  This is the
node at which a rotation will take place.  If you are in quiz mode, you will be asked to identify the type of rotation.
 Before proceeding to the next snapshot, be sure to try to predict what the tree will look like after the rotation
takes place.
