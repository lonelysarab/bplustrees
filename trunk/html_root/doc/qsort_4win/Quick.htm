In the quick sort algorithm being visualized here, the pivot is always
taken from the low index of the subarray being partitioned.  Snapshots
of the array are displayed after each call to the partition algorithm.
The picture in the upper left corner shows the actual data in the array
being manipulated.  The picture in the upper right corner displays the
relative magnitudes of the data in bar graph form.  The lower left corner
of the window shows the status of the stack frames on the system stack as
this particular recursive call is made.  Finally, the picture in the lower
right corner shows a run-time trace diagram of the recursive calls that
have been made to this point in the algorithm's execution.
