<BODY>
Here you will watch a succession of nodes being added to a 2-3-4 search tree.
The order of arrival of data for the tree is indicated at the top of the snapshot,
with the datum currently being added set off by asterisks.
In this implemetation of the 2-3-4 tree structure, a 4-node (that is, one with
3 data items and four pointers) is split whenever it is encountered on a trip
down a path in the tree.
Each time a node is added (by entering through the root), try to predict its
final location in the tree before proceeding to the next snapshot.
