<P>Once the distance array is initialized, Floyd's algorithm uses a dynamic programming algorithm to complete the
determination of the entries in it. For each matrix entry at row M and column P, we determine the length of the
shortest path from vertex M to vertex P along a path whose interior vertices are chosen from among 1, 2, ... N,
... V, where V is the number of vertices in the network. The V<SUP>3</SUP> loop to fill in the distance array is
given by:</P>

  for M = 1 to V do
    for P = 1 to V do
      /* Determine the distance of the shortest path from M to P through vertex N */
      distance[M,P] = min(distance[M,P], distance[M,N] + distance[N,P])
    endfor
  endfor

<P>As you watch the algorithm progress, yellow is used to highlight the distance entry that will change (<I><FONT
FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">distance[M,P]</FONT></I> ) because the sum
of the two red values (<I><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">distance[M,N] + distance[N,P]</FONT></I> ) is
less than the previous value stored at the yellow entry. As the snapshots progress, you will be asked to predict
the next value that will change in the distance array as the algorithm progresses.
