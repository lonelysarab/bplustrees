<h1>Insertion Sort </h1>
<p>The insertion sort attempts to take greater advantage of an array's partial ordering. The goal is that on the <em>k </em>th pass through, the element at index <em>k </em>among the entries within the list should be inserted into its rightful place among the first <em>k+1 </em> entries in the array. Thus, after the <em>k </em>th pass ( <em>k </em> starting at 1), the first <em>k+1 </em> elements of the array should be in sorted order. </p>
<p>This is analogous to the fashion in which many people pick up playing cards and arrange them in order in their hands. Holding the first ( <em>k </em> - 1) cards in order, a person will pick up the <em>(k+1) </em>st card and compare it with cards already held until its appropriate spot is found. </p>
