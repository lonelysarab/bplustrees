<h1><center>Binary Search Trees</center></h1>
<p>In computer science, a binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where every node has a value, every node's left subtree contains only values less than the node's value, and every node's right subtree contains only values that are greater than the node. A new node is added as a left of right subtree of another node which does not currently have that sub-tree filled.</p>
