<h1>Array Practice</h1>

<p>This tool helps you trace through Java code fragments that declare,
instantiate, initialize, and modify one-dimensional arrays. In
addition to operations on arrays, you will review <code>for</code>
loops, <code>if</code> statements, and related terminology.</p>

<p>This visualization tool is
divided into three viewing areas:</p>

<ol>

<li> On the left, the array is drawn in a vertical column, with its
contents reflecting the effects of the line-by-line execution of the
program.</li><BR>

<li>On the right (in the same pane in which you are reading this
information), the Java program is shown on numbered lines. The current
value of the loop variable is shown below the code. When the variable
is out of scope, its value is replaced with a dash. To see the code,
click on the Pseudo Code tab.<BR><BR>

<i>Note that the name of this tab does not properly describes its
contents since, in this visualization, the pane contains actual Java
code, not English-like pseudo-code. However, this is a legacy-code
issue with the JHAVE environment. Just remember:</i> <b>the code you see on
the right is not pseudo-code but real, syntactically correct Java
code</b>.</li><BR>

<li>Finally, at random points during the trace, a question will pop up
in a separate window. You must practice answering these questions to
master the material. Passively looking at the array visualization will
not do you much good. Active involvement through question-answering is
the most effective way to learn.</li>

</ol>

<p> At each point in the visualization process, a single line of code
is highlighted (in red) in the right pane. The left pane always
depicts the contents of the array after the previous line of code has
been executed. The highlighted line of code is shown in red as it is
about to be (that is, <b>before</b> it is) executed. When a
question pops up, it always refers to the current contents of the
array (left pane) and the currently highlighted line of code (right
pane).</p>

<p>When the highlighted line of code inside the loop body contains an
assignment statement, the expression on the left of the equal sign is
called <i>LHS</i> for left-hand side, while the expression on the right of
the equal sign is called <i>RHS</i> for right-hand side. Immediately after
an assignment statement is executed, the array location in LHS is
highlighted in blue in the left pane.</p>


<p>Every time you use this tool, a random array and a random loop are
generated. The name, length, and contents of the array are random. The
name of the loop variable, its starting value, whether it is
incremented (that is, increasing) or decremented (that is, decreasing)
during the execution of the loop, and by how much, are all random. So
are the the termination condition and body of the loop.</p>

<p>
The nature, number, and timing of questions is also random.  Since it
is virtually impossible to go through the same program twice, you are
encouraged to take advantage of this tool repeatedly. Doing so is the
only way to get acquainted with the complete set of questions you may
have to answer on the final exam.
</p>

<p><b>Have fun and good luck!</b></p>
