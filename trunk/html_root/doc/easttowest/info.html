<h3>What this visualization is all about</h3>
<p>
This visualization displays the effect of a call to a procedure
named <tt>fact</tt>, which implements the factorial function.
A definition of <tt>fact</tt> in a Java-like format appears below.
Observe that <tt>fact</tt> is recursive, that is, it contains a call
to itself.
<pre>
int fact (int n) {
    if (n == 0) 
        return 1;
    else
        return n * fact(n-1);
}
</pre>
