</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFCCFF">

<P>In the shortest path algorithm visualized here, the shortest path will be found from the red node to every other
node in the weighted graph. For each node, the top number in the node's circle is the node's identifying number,
and the bottom number (if there is one) is the shortest distance that Dijkstra's greedy algorithm has found up
to the present point of the algorithm's execution. Green highlights the nodes for which the shortest distance from
the red node has <I>definitely</I> been found, that is, those nodes that have been added to the closed list.  Yellow
highlights those nodes that have been opened but for which we are not yet sure of the shortest distance. When a
node switches from yellow to green, the shortest path from the start node to the newly closed node is highlighted
in red. As you step through the algorithm, always try to predict (1) the next node that will be closed and (2)
whether the distances to other nodes will change.  Whether these other distances change is dependent on whether
or not we have discovered a path through the newly closed node that is better than what had been the best distance
prior to closing this node.
