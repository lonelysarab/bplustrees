<BODY>
<P>
Here we have two variations of the quick sort algorithm -- the top two 
snapshots from the algorithm and data set you originally ran and the
bottom two snapshots from the most recently selected algorithm.  
For each algorithm, a snapshot of the array is
displayed after each call to the partition
algorithm. For
each algorithm, the left window displays the relative magnitude
of the data in bar graph form, and in the right window, there
is a run time trace of the recursive call pattern of the algorithm.
