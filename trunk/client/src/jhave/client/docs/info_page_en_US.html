  <h1>Welcome to JHAV&Eacute; Client 2.0</h1>
  
  <p>As this software is still in beta testing, please feel free to e-mail us with any
    problems you run into.</p>

  <p>Keep checking <a href="http://jhave.org">http://jhave.org</a>
    for updates. If you are using Webstart to launch your client, these
    updates will be deployed "automagically" each time you start your
    client.</p>

  <h2>How do I use JHAV&Eacute;?</h2>

    <p>Using JHAV&Eacute; is as simple as following the directions in the
    panel below! Make sure the server and category are correct for your class 
    and connect to the server. Once connected, please select an algorithm, 
    click <em>visualize</em>em>, and, if needed, select or create the dataset 
    that will provide input to the algorithm. It's that easy!</p>
