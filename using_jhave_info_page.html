  <H1>Welcome to JHAV&Eacute;</H1>
To use JHAV&Eacute; simply "Webstart" the JHAV&Eacute; client
available at http://jhave.org.  Once the client has started, make sure
the server and category are correct for your class and connect to the
server. (Accept the defaults for the server and category if you're not
using JHAV&Eacute; for a particular class.)  Once you have connected
to the server, select an algorithm, click visualize, and, if needed,
select or create the dataset that will provide input to the algorithm.
It's that easy!

<h2>Using JHAV&Eacute; to view visualizations in GAIGS script</h2>

<p>Most of the visualizations presently available from the
<i>jhave.org</i> site use an XML-based scripting language called
GAIGS.  When you're viewing one of these visualizations, 
remember that you can use your mouse in the graphics window to
drag the display of the algorithm -- particularly convenient
when part of the display is off the screen or poorly centered.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>The Gaigs plug-in for the JHAV&Eacute; Control Panel uses the
VCR-like controls to allow you view the algorithm depicted in the
graphics window.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Back</b> - takes you to the previous slide in the slideshow.
If this button is grayed out, then there is no previous slide to
the one you are currently viewing.</li>
<li><b>Next</b> - takes you to the next slide in the slideshow. If
this button is grayed out, then this is the end, my friend.</li>
<li><b>Magnify</b> - Scales up the visualization size.</li>
<li><b>Shrink</b> - Scales down the visualization size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Slider Bar</h3>
<p>This slider allows you to move directly to any particular slide
in the show.</p>
<h3>Option Menu</h3>
<p>If the Show Questions checkbox is checked, then questions will
be displayed on the screen for you to answer. You can keep going
and ignore the questions altogether if you wish, or even uncheck
this box and never see the questions. Otherwise, you can try to
answer the question and close the dialog box when you are done. The
Connection Config option currently does not save any configuration
information that you enter.</p>
<h3>File Menu</h3>
<p>If you are taking a course in which your instructor is using
JHAV&Eacute; to administer "for-real" quizzes, you will use the
quiz mode box to indicate that you are ready to take a quiz.</p>
